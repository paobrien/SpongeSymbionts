Group 1 = Sponge associated genomes
Group 2 = Genomes associated with other environments


Fisher exact test results:

True = Number of genomes with the gene
False = Number of genomes without the gene


Mann Whitney U test results:

Mean = Mean number of gene copies per genome
Fold change = Fold change in the number of gene copies per genome in group 1 compared to group 2
